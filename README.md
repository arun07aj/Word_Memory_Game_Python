# Word_Memory_Game_Python
A simple word memory game made using Python 2.7.
This is also my first Python project created during my first semester. 

The game consists of 10 levels. In each level, a set of random words will be displayed for a limited amount of time and after that it disappears.
The player should try to remember the words displayed and input these words one by one in the correct order as they were displayed and also with no spelling mistakes as well.
Once the player makes a mistake, the game is over. The total score will be displayed and the correct words will be displayed again for reference.
